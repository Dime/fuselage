  * Fix Known issues with Compass when next release available

    Note, in v0.8.17, there is currently a bug with this featureâ€¦ you may get this error:

    TypeError on line ["969"] of /usr/local/lib/ruby/1.9.1/pathname.rb: can't convert Pathname into String

    The bug is fixed in the (pre-release) version 0.10.0.pre4 of compass.
